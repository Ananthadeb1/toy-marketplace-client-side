                        <p>An access token and a refresh token are two commonly used concepts in authentication and authorization systems. They play a crucial role in securely accessing and refreshing authorization credentials for a user or an application </p>

                        <p>Client-side refers to the part of the application that runs on the users device (usually a web browser) and is responsible for handling the user interface and interactions. Server-side refers to the part of the application that runs on the server and is responsible for processing requests, performing business logic, and interacting with databases or other external systems.

                            Also we should store it in the local sotorage or in the cookies.But cookies is batter.

                <div><h1>What is JWT ??</h1></div>
                <hr className='w-75 mx-auto' />
                <p>JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.</p>
                <h4>How it works ?? </h4>
                <p>JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been granted.</p>
